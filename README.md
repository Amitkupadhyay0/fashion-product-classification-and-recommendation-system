# Fashion Product Classification and Recommendation System
## Introduction
This project focuses on creating a robust deep learning-based model for classifying fashion products into specific categories and gender. Additionally, it provides fashion product recommendations. The core of the system relies on leveraging the embedded layer output of a trained convolutional neural network (CNN) and employing cosine similarity for recommendation.

## Key Features

1. **Fashion Product Classification:** The system can accurately classify fashion products into categories and determine their gender, helping users quickly identify and search for specific items.

2. **Product Recommendation:** Based on an input image or user preferences, the system provides fashion product recommendations. These recommendations are generated by calculating the similarity between the input and other products using cosine similarity.

3. **Deep Learning Models:** The project utilizes pre-trained deep learning models for image classification. It includes models for predicting both fashion product categories and gender.

4. **Efficient Recommendation:** The use of cosine similarity ensures efficient recommendation by comparing the embedded representations of products, taking into account their visual features.

## How It Works

1. **Image Preprocessing:** When an image is provided as input, it undergoes preprocessing, including resizing and normalization, to prepare it for feature extraction.

2. **Category and Gender Prediction:** The system employs deep learning models to predict the category and gender of the fashion product in the input image.

3. **Filtering Data:** Based on the predicted category and gender, the system filters the product dataset to retrieve items that match the user's preferences.

4. **Cosine Similarity:** The embedded layer output of the CNN is used to represent product images. Cosine similarity is calculated between the input image embedding and the embeddings of products in the filtered dataset.

5. **Recommendation:** The system recommends a set of fashion products that have the highest cosine similarity with the input image. These recommendations are displayed to the user.

## Usage

1. **Input Image:** Users provide an input image of a fashion product they are interested in.

2. **Prediction:** The system predicts the category and gender of the product in the input image.

3. **Recommendation:** Fashion product recommendations are generated based on the predicted category and gender, offering users similar items to explore.

4. **Visual Display:** The input image and recommended products are displayed visually, allowing users to view and select their preferred items.
